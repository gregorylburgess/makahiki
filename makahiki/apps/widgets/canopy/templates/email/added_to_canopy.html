<p>Congratulations on your success in the {{ competition_name }}! You are now part of
    an exclusive group eligible to access a new part of the {{ competition_name }}
    website called the Canopy. The Canopy is a different type of {{ competition_name }}
    experience, focused on more in-depth investigations of energy data and
    discussion between members. You will find Canopy Missions to complete,
    some which are done solo, others require you to work in a group of 2-3
    Canopy members.</p>

<p>To keep things fair for the folks not in the Canopy, your activities
    in the Canopy earn you Canopy Karma rather than normal {{ competition_name }}
    points. But just to keep things interesting, we're going to give away
    a $25 UH Bookstore gift certificate to the Canopy member who has the
    most Karma at the end of the competition.</p>

<p>You can continue to access and participate in the other parts of the
    {{ competition_name }} website that you have already experienced, including earning
    more points there.</p>

<p>How do you get up there? Just log in and take a look "above you"!</p>

<p>Welcome to the Canopy!<br/><br/>
